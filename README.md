# Linked-Open-Terms-LOT-
Ontology Engineering has captured much attention during the last decades leading to the proliferation of numerous works regarding methodologies, guidelines, tools, resources, etc... including topics which are still many open questions when addresing a new ontology development project, regarding how to manage the overall project and articulate transitions between activities or which yasks and tools are recommended for each step. In this work we propose the Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology, and overall and lightweight methodologyfor building ontologies based on existing methodologies and oriented to semantic web developments and technologies. The LOT methodology focuses on the alignment with industrial development, in addition to academic and research projects, and software development, that is making ontology development part of the software industry. This methodology includes lessons learnt from more than 20 years in ontological engineering and its application on 18 projects is reported.
